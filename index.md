# About Me

I am a PhD student with Marc Ernst and Heiko Neumann at the Applied Cognitive Psychology Department at Ulm University.

In 2016, I graduated from Technical University MÃ¼nchen (TUM) with a Master's degree in Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence. For my master's thesis, I went to the [Cognitive Anteater Robotics Laboratory (CARL)](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/CARL/index.html) at the University of California  a junior specialist, working with Jeffrey Krichmar on a [computational model for spatial navigation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2017.00004/full).


In my PhD thesis, I am focusing on computational models for auditory sound source localization, multisensory integration and the deployment of such models on neuromorphic hardware and robotic platforms ([see project website](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/forschung/schwerpunkte/va-morph/)).
